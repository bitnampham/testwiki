Then it will show the Summary of the ratings and you can hit Submit to apply the changes.

## Step 4: App pricing

Now, it’s time to specify whether your app will be free or paid. If it is paid you can set the pricing of your app. Go to App pricing under the Monetize section in the left menu.

Note – You can transform a free app into a paid one but vice versa is not possible.

## Step 5: Upload App Bundles or AAB Files
Now arrives the principal step for which all the trauma is going on. Finally submit your app file to Google Play. Here you need to decide whether you want to release internal testing, alpha testing, beta testing, or production testing.

For that, from the App dashboard, go to the appropriate section and select Create a new release.

   ![New-release](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de1c0e47-6dce-4467-8518-6644637df9c4)

Now, select Create new release.

   ![Create-new-release](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77df0c5b-6773-46ee-9072-22d51058ef2b)

   ![App-bundles](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/489937e0-4419-448b-bcc0-af3901b0e682)

When you are done with all the details, you can check for errors and correct them. Then you can finally go for the Start rollout release for your android app.

Bingo! Your app is released for review to Google Play Store. Now all you have to do is wait for Google Play’s approval. It will take up to 7 days to get it approved. Once approved, it will be available publicly for download on Google Play Store.
